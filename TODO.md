# Todo
## Next to do
- Clean up logging, make verbose flag, add verbosity levels

## Immediate Priority

## High Priority 
- Inside album guess the album name gets inevitably overwritten!!!!!!!! Even if the song is not found in the album by youtube!!! This must be fixed, if yt does not find it, either leaf the track number blank but use the albums art and name, OR treat it as a single. NOT BOTH
- Create this list
- TODO: test with manufactured api results as inputs
- Enable support for other formats like flac

## Medium Priority
- Create Flowchart
- Metadata: Add Album Artist
- Metadata: Add Encoding stuff maybe
- Metadata: Add WOAR. Artist website or the streaming websites. MusicBrainz webiste seems to have links, havent found in the api response yet, gotta look
- User configurable id3 version
- FEAT: Give an option to download an entire album (--album flag)
- FEAT: Give an option to download everything from an artist (--artist flag)
- Add lyrics.ovh as lyrics API if youtube fails

## Low Priority
- Create an option that song names are always cleard of everything within a bracked e.g. "(2020 Remastered)"


## Distant future
- GUI?

## List of songs that create problems
- TEMP FIX "ghost - its a sin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfMVF-o7g1o (Genius says its in a album, but youtube does not have it in that album. Temporary fix is to download it as a single)
- ??? t.A.T.u. - All The Things She Said (Schrödingers API - Musicbrainz API sometimes returns the wrong artist with no tags. sometimes it returns the correct artist. not much i can do there)
- NO FIX "Delain - We are the Others" It downlaods the radio version, as this one has way more views for some reason. Querying "Delain - We are the Others Original" downloads the correct one.
- TODO: "Lordi - Hard rock Haleluja" Youtube is the only service that lists "Hardrock" without a space in between, so Musicbrainz and Deezer do not get results. Possible workaround would be as a fallback only search via artist name. This however may lead to wrong genre data for small artist that are not returned at the top!

## Howto install on windows
### General python installation:
- Download the installer from the website
- Say yes to everything in the installer
- Install via py -m pip install somedl
- If somedl command is not recognized, add scripts folder to path (This is not a somedl problem, this is a general python issue)
    - Typically something like C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\pythoncore-3.14-64\Scripts depending on your python version and mode of installation
    - Type environment variables in the search, open "Edit the system environment variables"
    - In there, at the bottom click "Environment Variables..."
    - Click on "Path" and then "Edit"
    - Click "New" and then paste the path of the scripts folder in there
    - Click OK on all windows

### Install ffmepeg

https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases

- extract to C:/ffmpeg or somewhere similar
- Go into the extracted folder, there into the bin folder
- there should be a ffmpeg.exe among others.
- Copy the filepath of the bin folder and add it to path (like with python before)

### Install deno
yt-dlp needs deno to properly work (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS). SomeDL should work without it, but yt-dlp will always print a warning. 
- To install deno, go to https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/
- If you have npm installed, you can use npm to install deno. If not, open PowerShell (not CMD!) and execute the command provided. (This downloads and installs a script, be aware to only do this from trusted sources!)
