https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/

## [0.2.2] - 2026.03.02

### Fixed
- Fix problem with invalid file name characters (?*"/\ etc) on windows, where it would throw an error when one of these characters are present in the file name. With a simple sanitize fuction, these characters are now replaced with underscores _



## [0.2.1] - 2026.02.27
### Changed
- Changed deezer warnings to log.warning and log.error instead of print statements
- Add possibility for musicbrainz to only search by artist name if previous normal search and clean search attempts failed. This usually only leads to results if a song name is spelled differently on youtube music as compared to musicbrainz. 
- Added config option "mb_retry_artist_name_only" for this behaviour. Default = True
- In "Check if artist has already been seen", add a check that if the previous attempt has led to no results, continue (either to a entry with correct metadata, or to the end and search for metadata yourself) (but only if mb_retry_artist_name_only is False!). However, if the previous search failed because of a timeout, search again. 
- Add Search with cleaned song title for deezer if previous attempt fails
- The requirement for checking the album is now only if the album type is single or EP, mathching names is no longer required

### Fixed
- Fix bug where genius would not return any results because of empty api token, now it sends an empty header and it works again
- Fixed deezer logging (only show not found warning when the second try has not gotten any result)


## [0.2.0] - 2026.02.24
### Overview:
You can now download age restricted videos by providing --cookies-from-browser followed by the name of your browser where you are logged into youtube with an age verified account.
Download reports are only generated if more than one song inputs are present. When setting the -R flag, the download report is always generated.

### Added
- Add support for downloading age restricted songs by supporting the --cookies-from-browser BROWSER flag or the --cookies flag.
- Add --no-musicbrainz flag to download songs without fetching musicbrainz data (Genre). This can be used when the musicbrainz API causes problems.
- Add download time to download report
- Add --version flag
- Add integrated version check. Runs with every command.

### Fixed
- DownloadError was not properly importet from yt-dlp
- Fix bug, where adding metadata would fail if a previous search of the same artist that yielded no musicbrainz info (because --no-musicbrainz was set) would result in an Invalid MultiSpec data: None error. Added empty string as exception value of .get instead of None
- Returne false if file was not downloaded properly to put the song into the failed list

### Changed
- Download reports 
- Lowered failed download log level to ERROR instead of CRITICAL
- Added informative suggestions (age restriction, ffmpeg) to error message
- Switched recording and artist in the musicbrainz API prompt (new prompt: https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording/?query=artist:"{artist}" AND recording:"{song}"&fmt=json). Having it the other way round prioritizes recording names over artist names.
- Changed 5 seconds musicbrainz timeout to 5 + retry_coundter^2 to wait longer if more retries are needed.

## [0.1.2] - 2026.02.23
### Changed
